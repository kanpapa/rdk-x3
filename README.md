3D model of RDK X3 board created for FreeCAD.

- rdk-x3-simple  
The RDK X3 STEP file provided on the official website could not be read by FreeCAD. So we created a simple 3D model of the RDK X3 board that can be used with FreeCAD.
This CAD data is experimental and non-guaranteed. Therefore, please be aware that the CAD data may be inaccurate.

- rdk-x3-camera-holder  
This holder can be used to secure the XDR-X3 Camera Module to a double clip. It is a simple but flexible fixing method. This data is optimized for my 3D printer, so please fine-tune the size and position of the mounting holes and the position of the double clip attachment to suit your 3D printer.
